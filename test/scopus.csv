The content of impurity crystalline phases was less than 0.1%	 according to synchrotron diffractometry (SXRD) data. Anisotropic crystallite sizes (Formula presented.) were determined by XRD. A low resistance covering layer of mechanically strong ferric-graphite-graphene composite with impregnated ferric (Fe3+) particles &lt; 10 nm in size increases the cycleability compared to industrial cathodes. In accordance with the corrosion model	 the destruction of the Fe3+-containing protective layer of crystallites predominates at the first stage	 and at the second stage Fe escapes into the electrolyte and to the anode. The crystallite size decreases due to amorphization that starts from the surface. The rate capability	 Q(t)	 has been studied as a function of (Formula presented.)	 of the correlation coefficients (Formula presented.) between crystallite sizes	 of the Li diffusion coefficient	 D	 and of the electrical relaxation time	 τel.

For example	 on folded square hierarchical lattices (FSHLs) one can obtain an exact solution even for rather complicated models such as the two-layer Ising model. But this model has a simple behavior	 so we chose a similar model with a much more diverse phase behavior. In this work	 we have studied the Ashkin–Teller model on the first two representatives of the FSHLs family. An additional calculation was carried out on a square lattice by tensor renormalization group for a more visual comparison of the results. Based on the calculation results	 we have constructed phase diagrams for symmetric and asymmetric cases. As expected	 the diagrams are qualitatively the same for square and hierarchical lattices. There are areas with a noticeable deviation	 but in some places the result corresponds to the exact solution. The second occurs only where the critical values of the model are determined by logarithms of algebraic numbers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

Once the tensor network is built	 various methods can be used to calculate the partition function of the corresponding model. However	 it is possible to build the initial tensor network in different ways for the same model. In this work	 we have proposed two ways of constructing tensor networks and demonstrated that the construction process affects the accuracy of calculations. For demonstration purposes	 we have done a brief study of the 4 nearest-neighbor (NN) and 5NN models	 where adsorbed particles exclude all sites up to the fourth and fifth nearest neighbors from being occupied by another particle. In addition	 we have studied a 4NN model with finite repulsions with a fifth neighbor. In a sense	 this model is intermediate between 4NN and 5NN models	 so algorithms designed for systems with hard-core interactions may experience difficulties. We have obtained adsorption isotherms	 as well as graphs of entropy and heat capacity for all models. The critical values of the chemical potential were determined from the position of the heat capacity peaks. As a result	 we were able to improve our previous estimate of the position of the phase transition points for the 4NN and 5NN models. And in the model with finite interactions	 we found the presence of two first-order phase transitions and made an estimate of the critical values of the chemical potential for them. © 2023 American Physical Society."

The κ(ε)-Ga2O3:Sn and SnO2 films were grown by the halide vapor phase epitaxy and the high-frequency magnetron sputtering	 respectively. The gas sensor response and speed of operation of the structures under H2 exposure exceeded the corresponding values of single κ(ε)-Ga2O3:Sn and SnO2 films within the temperature range of 25–175 °C. Meanwhile	 the investigated heterostructures demonstrated a low response to CO	 NH3	 and CH4 gases and a high response to NO2	 even at low concentrations of 100 ppm. The current responses of the SnO2/κ(ε)-Ga2O3:Sn structure to 104 ppm of H2 and 100 ppm of NO2 were 30–47 arb. un. and 3.7 arb. un.	 correspondingly	 at a temperature of 125 °C. The increase in the sensitivity of heterostructures at low temperatures is explained by a rise of the electron concentration and a change of a microrelief of the SnO2 film surface when depositing on κ(ε)-Ga2O3:Sn.

It first searches for the edge segment of the road sign. The boundary curve of the road sign is defined by the boundary of the edge segment. Approximating the boundaries of a road sign reveals its shape. The hierarchical road sign recognition system forms classes in the form of a sign. Six classes are at the first level. Two classes contain only one road sign. Signs are classified by the color of the edge segment at the second level of the hierarchy. The image inside the edge segment is cut at the third level of the hierarchy. The sign is then identified based on a comparison of the pattern. A computer experiment was carried out on two collections of road signs. The proposed algorithm has a high operating speed and a low percentage of errors. © 2023 by the authors.	classification methods; image recognition; image segmentation; traffic signs	MDPI	20782489			Article	Scopus	proposes algorithm recognizing road sign based determination color shape first search edge segment road sign boundary curve road sign defined boundary edge segment approximating boundary road sign reveals shape hierarchical road sign recognition system form class form sign six class first level two class contain one road sign sign classified color edge segment second level hierarchy image inside edge segment cut third level hierarchy sign identified based comparison pattern computer experiment wa carried two collection road sign proposed algorithm high operating speed low percentage error

Computer simulations use the Heisenberg model and Metropolis algorithm. The array consists of small nanowires that are monodomain. The exchange interaction orders the spins within a single nanowire. Dipole–dipole forces act between neighboring nanowires. The shape of an individual nanowire affects its magnetic anisotropy. Computer simulations examine the phase transition temperature and magnetization behavior of the system. The type of magnetic moments ordering in the array of nanowires depends on the orientation of their long axis. We consider two types of systems. The nanowires’ long axes are oriented perpendicular to the plane of their location in the first case. A dipole–dipole interaction results in first-type superantiferromagnetic ordering of the nanowires’ magnetic moments for such orientation. The nanowires’ long axes are oriented in the plane of the system in the second case. Dipole–dipole interaction results in second-type superantiferromagnetic ordering in such systems. The dependence of the phase transition temperature on the dipole–dipole interaction intensity is investigated. © 2023 by the authors.	nanowires 2D array; phase transition; superantiferromagnetic ordering	MDPI	19961944			Article	Scopus	considers nanowires 2d array located node square lattice computer simulation use heisenberg model metropolis algorithm array consists small nanowires monodomain exchange interaction order spin within single nanowire dipole-dipole force act neighboring nanowires shape individual nanowire affect magnetic anisotropy computer simulation examine phase transition temperature magnetization behavior system type magnetic moment ordering array nanowires depends orientation long axis two type system nanowires long ax oriented perpendicular plane location first case dipole-dipole interaction result first-type superantiferromagnetic ordering nanowires magnetic moment orientation nanowires long ax oriented plane system second case dipole-dipole interaction result second-type superantiferromagnetic ordering system dependence phase transition temperature dipole-dipole interaction intensity investigated

In AE	 time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation is considered a key parameter for the accurate localization of a growing defect. This paper describes an entropy-based filtering approach for the ToA estimation of noisy signals and compares its performance to that of the commonly adopted Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The proposed method consists in coarsening the input data using the Crutchfield-Packard algorithm and calculating the local (instantaneous) entropy. In the present study	 we demonstrate that the local entropy of the background noise component differs from the useful (informative) signal. As a result	 the approach permits filtering the noise component by selecting a proper threshold value. The proposed method has been tested on experimental data aimed at localizing a source of AE in a square 1 × 1 m aluminum plate. The entropy approach allows an overreaching precision in the final localization of the targets compared to the classical AIC. © 2023	 The Author(s)	 under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Yet	 such calculations had been performed in a simplified approach with a schematic nucleus–nucleus potential. The present paper aims to evaluate accurately the sub-barrier capture cross sections in the collision of oxigen-16 with spherical nuclei using a realistic potential and to compare the calculated cross sections with the experimental data. The nucleus–nucleus potential is evaluated within the framework of the double-folding model with M3Y–Paris nucleon–nucleon forces. The nucleon densities are borrowed from the IAEA data base	 they were computed using the Hartree–Fock–Bogolubov methos and approximated by the two-parameter Fermi formula. The transmission coefficients are evaluated using the WKB approximation below the barrier and the parabolic barrier approximation above the barrier. The proposed novel method to account for ZPO does not use any adjustable parameters. It is demonstrated that ignoring ZPO results in underestimating experimental data whereas accounting for ZPO allows to reach a better agreement. © 2023	 Allerton Press	 Inc."	double-folding model; heavy-ion fusion; quadrupole zero-point oscillations	Pleiades Publishing	00271349			Article	Scopus	earlier wa shown literature accounting zero-point oscillation zpo colliding nucleus shape result significant increase calculated sub-barrier capture fusion cross section yet calculation performed simplified approach schematic nucleus-nucleus potential evaluate accurately sub-barrier capture cross section collision oxigen-16 spherical nucleus using realistic potential compare calculated cross section experimental data nucleus-nucleus potential evaluated within framework double-folding model m3y-paris nucleon-nucleon force nucleon density borrowed iaea data base computed using hartree-fock-bogolubov methos approximated two-parameter fermi formula transmission coefficient evaluated using wkb approximation barrier parabolic barrier approximation barrier proposed novel method account zpo doe use adjustable parameter demonstrated ignoring zpo result underestimating experimental data whereas accounting zpo allows reach better agreement

Ni-Mg-Al hydroxides were prepared by the coprecipitation method. It was found that the samples dried at 110 °C were layered Ni-Mg-Al hydroxides with a hydrotalcite-type structure. After the heat treatment at 600 °C	 the formation of Ni-Mg-Al-mixed oxides with a specific nanostructure	 an intermediate between a NaCl and spinel structure	 took place. According to XRD data	 it had the unit cell parameter a = 4.174–4.181 Å	 and a crystallite size of 4.0 nm. The specific surface area of the Ni-Mg-Al samples dried at 110 °C was 45–54 m2/g	 and that of those calcined at 600 °C was 156.1–209.1 m2/g. In agreement with HRTEM data	 in all the synthesized nickel catalysts reduced at 700 °C (H2)	 particle size was mainly distributed between 15–20 nm. The catalyst activity of LDH-derived Ni-Mg-Al catalysts in ammonia decomposition was studied in a fixed-bed flow-type reactor at an atmospheric pressure within the temperature range 500–700 °C. The synthesized catalysts overcame existing analogues in catalytic performance.

Construction of a problem-oriented tool for forecasting electricity consumption in small northern settlements is of paramount importance for the implementation of development plans for Arctic and Far North regions. At present	 a large number of electricity consumption forecasting methods are used	 including expert	 statistical	 artificial intelligence methods	 hybrid methods	 and others. As a rule	 there is no universal method	 equally effective (by the criterion «counting time - counting accuracy») for the main types of problems of electricity consumption forecasting. The noted circumstance requires research in the direction of creating a computational complex: identification of computational properties of electricity consumption model - construction of an adequate method of information extraction. The purpose: development of an approach based on a retrospective regression analysis	 which allows making adaptive short-term forecasting of electricity consumption of regional isolated electrical complexes. Methods. The approach to obtain short-term forecasts of electricity consumption of regional isolated electrical complexes is based on a retrospective regression analysis. The predictive model based on the feedback from regionally isolated electrical complexes responses is presented in the form of a linear regression with an internal set of functions forming an orthogonal and orthonormalized basis. At the same time the preliminary information received from the object - feedback from regionally isolated electrical complexes	 is written in the form of a system of linear algebraic equations presented in matrix form. Finding of coefficients at basis functions is carried out taking into account the method of least squares	 and the solution of the received equations - on the basis of Kaczmarz method. Verification of performance of the developed approach was carried out by means of the analysis of regression residuals of forecasting Results. With the help of adaptive short-term forecasting of electric power consumption by autonomous power systems of small northern settlements based on the methods of retrospective regression analysis the short-term forecast for the prediction interval of 30 minutes was obtained. Conclusions. An approach is proposed to consider short-term forecasting of electricity consumption by autonomous energy systems in small northern settlements based on regression analysis methods. The paper demonstrates significant advantage of the developed approach related to the fact that when building a procedure for adaptive short-term prediction of energy consumption based on retrospective regression analysis the rationalization combination of identifying coefficients at basis functions and rebuilding the mathematical model of a non-stationary discrete stochastic process at each step occurs. The analysis of regression residuals of feedback from regionally isolated electrical complexes forecasting was carried out and the performance of the developed algorithm of electricity forecasting and the adequacy of the accepted provisions in forming a priori information when implementing the approach to short-term forecasting of a stochastic process based on retrospective regression analysis was confirmed. © 2023 Tomsk Polytechnic University	 Publishing House.

One of the advanced methods for constructing this potential is the semi-microscopical double-folding model with M3Y-Paris NN-forces. Proton and neutron densities are significant components of this model. The correct nucleon density (ND) must reproduce the experimental nuclear charge density (NCD). However	 those who deal with modeling the fusion process typically disregard this circumstance. We aim to achieve a good description of both the nuclear charge density and above-barrier fusion cross sections of even-even light nuclei with . We consider several versions of NDs available in literature and construct our own approximation for the ND of the even-even spherical nuclei 12C	 16O	 and 40Ca	 abbreviated as FE-density (Fermi+exponential). We carefully compare the NCDs resulting from different versions of NDs with the experimental NCDs. After finding the nucleus-nucleus potential using the double-folding model with the density dependent M3Y-Paris NN-forces and FE densities	 we evaluate the above-barrier fusion cross sections for five reactions	 12C+12C	 12C+16O	 16O+16O	 16O+40Ca	 and 40Ca+40Ca	 for which experimental data are available. The cross sections are calculated using two approaches: a) the barrier penetration model and b) the trajectory model with surface friction (TM). To find the transmission coefficients for the TM	 the Langevin equations are employed. For all considered reactions	 our TM typically reproduces the above-barrier experimental cross sections within 10−15%. The only adjustable parameter of the model	 the optimal friction strength 	 is found to be approximately 90 for the light reactions 12C+12C	 12C+16O	 and 16O+16O and approximately 15 for the heavy reactions 16O+40Ca and 40Ca+40Ca. The latter findings are in reasonable agreement with the systematics found previously. Thus	 the FE-recipe allows highly accurate and simultaneous reproduction of both the nuclear charge density and above-barrier fusion cross sections of five reactions involving 12C	 16O	 and 40Ca nuclei. © 2023 Chinese Physical Society and the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and IOP Publishing Ltd"	double-folding model; heavy-ion fusion; nuclear charge densities; nucleon densities; surface friction	Institute of Physics	16741137			Article	Scopus	theoretical modeling nucleus-nucleus collision often based nucleus-nucleus potential one advanced method constructing potential semi-microscopical double-folding model m3y-paris nn-forces proton neutron density significant component model correct nucleon density nd must reproduce experimental nuclear charge density ncd however deal modeling fusion process typically disregard circumstance achieve good description nuclear charge density above-barrier fusion cross section even-even light nucleus several version nd available literature construct approximation nd even-even spherical nucleus 12c 16o 40ca abbreviated fe-density fermiexponential carefully compare ncds resulting different version nd experimental ncds finding nucleus-nucleus potential using double-folding model density dependent m3y-paris nn-forces fe density evaluate above-barrier fusion cross section five reaction 12c12c 12c16o 16o16o 16o40ca 40ca40ca experimental data available cross section calculated using two approach barrier penetration model b trajectory model surface friction tm find transmission coefficient tm langevin equation employed considered reaction tm typically reproduces above-barrier experimental cross section within 1015 adjustable parameter model optimal friction strength found approximately 90 light reaction 12c12c 12c16o 16o16o approximately 15 heavy reaction 16o40ca 40ca40ca latter finding reasonable agreement systematics found previously thus fe-recipe allows highly accurate simultaneous reproduction nuclear charge density above-barrier fusion cross section five reaction involving 12c 16o 40ca nucleus

Yet the heavy-ion capture cross sections are calculated theoretically with significant uncertainties. In particular	 these cross sections below the barrier sometimes underestimate the experimental ones by orders of magnitude. In the literature	 it had been shown that accounting for the Zero-Point Oscillations (ZPO) of the shape of colliding nuclei increased significantly the calculated capture cross sections. However	 those calculations had been performed in a simplified way with a schematic nucleus-nucleus potential and for few reactions. The purpose of the present paper is to account for the ZPO in a more realistic way and to compare systematically the resulting capture cross sections with the experimental data. In the present paper	 the nucleus-nucleus potential is evaluated using the semi-microscopical double-folding model with M3Y-Paris nucleon-nucleon forces. The nucleon densities needed for finding this potential are generated from the experimental three-parameter Fermi charge densities.

Among the existing methods that give an acceptable result in terms of accuracy	 one can single out approaches based on the ARIMA econometric method. A method based on the Wold decomposition and correlation functions of the stochastic process is considered	 an adaptive model of the difference equation is constructed	 which makes it possible to predict energy consumption of the active power of autonomous systems of a small settlement in the interval of 0–4 hours	 by reducing the stochastic process to a stationary Markov process with short memory. The purpose of the work is to build a methodology for short-term forecasting of electric energy consumption by autonomous energy systems of small northern settlements	 taking into account the specifics of energy consumption in the conditions of the Arctic zone and the Far North	 based on a stochastic series of data on electric energy consumed by the settlement over the previous period. Methods: approach to obtaining a short-term forecast of electricity consumption by autonomous energy systems of small northern settlements based on the ARIMA econometric method. In this case	 a difference equation is constructed for the deterministic and random components of the available stochastic series of energy consumption; Wold decomposition and correlation functions of the energy consumption are used. To adapt the model	 the studied stochastic process is reduced to a Markov process with a short memory. To do this	 it is necessary to use a difference operator	 which reduces the relative contribution of consumption deterministic component. Results. Based on Wold decomposition and correlation functions	 it was possible to obtain a model that gives a short-term forecast of active power consumption for a lead time of 4 hours. Conclusions. Based on the Wold decomposition and the correlation functions of the stochastic process	 the authors of the work managed to obtain an adaptive model of the difference equation	 which makes it possible to predict active power consumption of autonomous systems of a small settlement with a lead time of 4 hours. The stationarity of the random process was carried out by introducing a difference operator of the first order	 which makes it possible to reduce the relative contribution of the deterministic component of the stochastic series. The authors managed to reduce the process to a stationary Markov process with a short memory. The expansion coefficients of the difference equation were estimated by solving a nonlinear equation	 which consists in finding the global maximum of the likelihood function. The constructed 90 % probabilistic boundaries allow us to talk about a satisfactory adjustment of the adaptive parameters of the difference equation for predicting the system.

The processes occurring in the cutting zone contribute to the rapid wear of the cutting tool and a decrease in the quality of the workpiece. It is possible to reduce the impact of negative factors during metal cutting through a rational choice of coolant. The aim of the work is to develop a methodology for the accelerated assessment of the coolant lubricating properties. Methods. This paper presents experimental studies of the lubricating effect of seven different grades of coolant	 during friction of a T15K6 (15 % TiC–79% WC–6 % Co) hard alloy pad and a rotating roller made of carbon structural Steel 45 (0.45 % C) are presented. As a parameter of coolant efficiency in terms of lubricating effect	 this paper proposes an efficiency coefficient Kc	 which is equal to the ratio between the friction coefficient that occurs when using coolant and the friction coefficient during friction without coolant. The lower the coefficient Kc	 the more effective this coolant is in terms of lubricating effect. Results. Empirical dependences of the coefficient Kc on the coolant density ρ and the limiting wetting angle Θ (Kc = f(ρ; Θ)) are established. Since the low significance of the parameter ρ is established	 the formula for the dependence of the Kc only on the limiting wetting angle Θ (Kc = f(Θ)) is established in the work. It is established that the dependence formula (Kc = f(Θ) provides the highest accuracy of calculations. Discussion. After evaluating the research results presented in this paper	 the following conclusions are made: 1) the paper establishes the influence of the coolant density and the limiting wetting angle on the coolant efficiency coefficient for the lubricating effect determined for the friction between a roller made of Steel 45 and a pad made of T15K6 alloy: Kc = f(ρ; Θ) and Kc = f(Θ); 2) the greatest accuracy of calculations from 2.75 to 15 % is provided by the formula for the dependence Kc = f(Θ); 3) the dependence Kc = f(Θ)is proposed to be used for the method for the accelerated assessment of the coolant lubricating properties during friction of a pad made of T15K6 alloy and a rotating roller made of Steel 45. The proposed method consists in measuring the limiting wetting angle of a coolant drop on the surface of the workpiece and calculating the derived empirical dependence of the coolant efficiency coefficient on the lubricating effect. © 2023 The Authors.

Through the fate of Liudmila Abramova the authors attempt to reflect the peculiarities of the life of the emigrants in Northern Manchuria in the interwar period. They include the involvement of young people in fascist organizations	 work in the Manchukuo authorities	 survival strategies	 repatriation motives	 adaptation practices of repatriates	 gender aspects – such as the role of a politician's wife	 the participation of women in public organizations. The appeal to the personalized history is due to the fact that in the history of Russian emigration in Manchuria there are many mythologemes that distort the idea of the life and activities of emigrants. In addition	 the authors had to face the problem of reconstructing the biography of a “little” person in the absence of ego documents (memoirs	 letters	 diaries); therefore	 the research task was the use of the anthropological approach	 micro- and macroanalysis	 historical-biographical and historicalcomparative methods.

His biography	 which has not been previously presented in the scholarship	 vividly reflects the collisions of the era of social cataclysms. The research has been carried out on the basis of the theory of social adaptation	 the anthropological approach and the historical and biographical methods as a methodological basis defining its genre. The article considers the issue presented in the article in connection with the historiography of the problem. The basis for the study was a complex of unpublished sources of an official nature discovered by the author in the funds of the Historical Archive of the Omsk Region and the archive of the Office of the Federal Security Service of Russia in the Omsk Region	 among which of most significance were the track record of P.N.Velizhanin for 1919; Soviet questionnaires; investigative documents of the Cheka; materials of departmental office work related to military and special (Chekist) registration of the subject of the study in the 1920s. As a result	 a controversial biography of P.N.Velizhanin is reconstructed with the highest level of detail. The conclusion emphasizes this officer’s relatively successful social adaptation in Soviet Omsk	 whose military (and anti-Bolshevik) biography was complemented by the leadership of military penitentiary institutions. The publication may be of interest to a wide range of readers — to researchers into Russian military history	 into Russian special services	 into the Soviet society	 into the repressive policy of the Soviet state	 as well as to specialists in the field of practical genealogy. © 2023 Saint-Petersburg State University.

The present paper describes the method to produce metal–carbon composites	 Pt1−xNix/CNF	 with an adjustable Pt/Ni ratio. The composites represent Pt1−xNix (x = 0.0–1.0) nanoparticles embedded within a structure of carbon nanofibers (CNF). The synthesis of the composites is based on a spontaneous disintegration of Pt1−xNix alloys in an ethylene-containing atmosphere with the formation of CNF. The initial Pt1−xNix alloys were prepared by thermolysis of multicomponent precursors. They possess a porous structure formed by fragments of 100–200 nm. As was shown by X-ray diffraction analysis	 the crystal structure of the alloys containing 0–30 and 60–100 at.% Ni corresponds to a fcc lattice based on platinum (Fm-3m)	 while the Pt0.50Ni0.50 sample is an intermetallic compound with the tetragonal structure (P4/mmm). The impact of the Ni content in the Pt1−xNix samples on their activity in ethylene decomposition was studied as well. As was revealed	 the efficiency of Pt1−xNix alloys in this process increases with the rise of Ni concentration. The composite samples were examined in an electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction. The synthesized Pt1-xNix/CNF composites demonstrated superior activity if compared with the Pt/Vulcan commercial catalyst. © 2023 by the authors."	carbon nanofibers; electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction; nanoalloys; nickel; platinum; X-ray diffraction analysis	MDPI	20734344			Article	Scopus	development new heterogeneous pt-containing catalyst retained relevance past decade describes method produce metal-carbon composite pt1xnixcnf adjustable ptni ratio composite represent pt1xnix x 00-10 nanoparticles embedded within structure carbon nanofibers cnf synthesis composite based spontaneous disintegration pt1xnix alloy ethylene-containing atmosphere formation cnf initial pt1xnix alloy prepared thermolysis multicomponent precursor posse porous structure formed fragment 100-200 nm wa shown x-ray diffraction analysis crystal structure alloy containing 0-30 60-100 ni corresponds fcc lattice based platinum fm-3m pt050ni050 sample intermetallic compound tetragonal structure p4mmm impact ni content pt1xnix sample activity ethylene decomposition wa studied well wa revealed efficiency pt1xnix alloy process increase rise ni concentration composite sample examined electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction synthesized pt1-xnixcnf composite demonstrated superior activity compared ptvulcan commercial catalyst

The model takes into account the mutual influence of tribological and operating parameters of the stage. To specify conditions for the mathematical model to be unambiguous	 experiments were carried out to determine the values of the friction coefficient and the maximum allowable sliding speed of promising self-lubricating materials as functions of the load and speed parameters of the compressor stage. Mathematical modeling of the integral energy characteristics of the oilless stage of the rotary vane type has shown the conceptual option to expand the range of its operation modes based on the justified use of self-lubricating materials in friction units and account of the mutual influence of tribological and operational factors. Theoretical studies have confirmed that the speed of the stage and the degree of pressure can be increased by a factor no less than 2 compared with those of commercially produced machines. However	 setting the friction coefficient in modeling stages of a rotary vane type as a constant can lead to incorrect conclusions in designing in what regards the best operating and structural parameters of the stage. Increasing the speed of the oilless stage of the rotary vane type will enable a reduction in the production requirements for end clearances and an increase in the specific weight and size characteristics and the degree of pressure increase in the stage by a factor of 1.5–2 for the effective efficiency values of 0.8 or more. The proposed mathematical model makes it possible to more accurately predict the energy losses related to mechanical friction in the stages and the integral energy characteristics of the stage in a wide range of operating and design parameters. © 2023	 Allerton Press	 Inc."	friction; mathematical model; plate; rotary vane compressor	Pleiades Publishing	10683666			Article	Scopus	mathematical model oilless rotary vane compressor presented model take account mutual influence tribological operating parameter stage specify condition mathematical model unambiguous experiment carried determine value friction coefficient maximum allowable sliding speed promising self-lubricating material function load speed parameter compressor stage mathematical modeling integral energy characteristic oilless stage rotary vane type shown conceptual option expand range operation mode based justified use self-lubricating material friction unit account mutual influence tribological operational factor theoretical confirmed speed stage degree pressure increased factor le 2 compared commercially produced machine however setting friction coefficient modeling stage rotary vane type constant lead incorrect conclusion designing regard best operating structural parameter stage increasing speed oilless stage rotary vane type enable reduction production requirement end clearance increase specific weight size characteristic degree pressure increase stage factor 15-2 effective efficiency value 08 proposed mathematical model make possible accurately predict energy loss related mechanical friction stage integral energy characteristic stage wide range operating design parameter

Appropriate engine restart conditions must be provided as part of this process. Ullage motors have been traditionally employed to induce active settling and ensure a gas-free propellant supply to the engines. Although robust and reliable	 ullage motors are also heavy	 which motivates the study of alternative approaches to the problem. Classic propellant management devices could potentially be employed in this context	 but they are hardly applicable to high flow rate cryogenic liquid systems. This paper explores several novel propellant settling strategies that are particularly well suited for cryogenic propellants. In particular	 three distinct Magnetic Positive Positioning concepts	 a hydrogen-peroxide-based Propellant Gasification System	 and a hybrid device that combines both approaches are introduced.

A four-dimensional dynamical Langevin model	 implementing various prescriptions of the asymptotic level-density parameter a˜	 is employed to demonstrate the relevance of considering typical fission observables	 and namely the pre- and post-scission neutron multiplicities	 to investigate the evolution of a˜ with N and Z. The richness of fission is shown to offer an alternative route	 that is very complementary to the conventional fusion-evaporation method from which no consensus emerged yet. In particular	 to investigate the isospin-dependence of the NLD	 the present calculations lead us to propose a series of fusion-induced fission measurements based on Ca + Pb collisions which are readily available at current experimental facilities.

The intensification of the coolant movement increases in the machine	 which can reduce the temperature of the cylinder–piston group and increase the indicator efficiency and the compressor feed rate. A mathematical model of working processes in a reciprocating compressor and its cooling system has been developed on the basic fundamental laws of conservation of energy	 mass and motion. A prototype was developed and tested to obtain new knowledge about the processes in the machine and confirm the assumptions made while developing the mathematical model. After a series of experiments	 the influence of cooling on the working processes in a reciprocating compressor	 the technical work carried out in each working process	 the energy and consumption characteristics of a reciprocating compressor with a developed cooling system were established. There was a validation performed of the developed mathematical model of work processes in the machine and the assumptions made. According to the developed mathematical model of work processes	 a numerical experiment was carried out	 which established: the coolant flow rate decreases with an increase in discharge pressure and increases with an increase in the crankshaft speed when the discharge pressure changes from 0.4 MPa to 0.8 MPa	 a decrease in the indicator isothermal efficiency due to the leakage and non-isothermal nature of the compression process	 as well as a decrease in the return work in the process of reverse expansion	 leading to a decrease in the indicator isothermal efficiency of more than 15%; due to the equalization of pressures in the gas cavities with an increase in discharge pressure	 the coolant consumption is reduced by (15 ± 17)%; with an increase in the angular speed of the crankshaft from 800 rpm to 1500 rpm	 the coolant flow rate increases by more than 2.5 times	 this increase in coolant flow rate is due to an increase in hydraulic resistance due to an increase in gas velocity; in the range from 1000 to 1200 rpm	 a maximum of the indicator isothermal efficiency and compressor feed rate is observed; maximum indicator isothermal efficiency and the supply ratio is observed at a coolant flow rate in the range from 800 mL/min to 900 mL/min. © 2023 by the authors."	coolant movement; gas vacuum at suction; indicator efficiency; liquid cooling system; reciprocating compressor; volumetric efficiency	MDPI	19961073			Article	Scopus	new pumpless liquid cooling system single-stage two-cylinder reciprocating compressor developed analysis work process cooling system reciprocating compressor one piston compress move gas coolant cooling system intensification coolant movement increase machine reduce temperature cylinder-piston group increase indicator efficiency compressor feed rate mathematical model working process reciprocating compressor cooling system developed basic fundamental law conservation energy mass motion prototype wa developed tested obtain new knowledge process machine confirm assumption made developing mathematical model series experiment influence cooling working process reciprocating compressor technical work carried working process energy consumption characteristic reciprocating compressor developed cooling system established wa validation performed developed mathematical model work process machine assumption made according developed mathematical model work process numerical experiment wa carried established coolant flow rate decrease increase discharge pressure increase increase crankshaft speed discharge pressure change 04 mpa 08 mpa decrease indicator isothermal efficiency due leakage non-isothermal nature compression process well decrease return work process reverse expansion leading decrease indicator isothermal efficiency 15 due equalization pressure gas cavity increase discharge pressure coolant consumption reduced 15 17 increase angular speed crankshaft 800 rpm 1500 rpm coolant flow rate increase 25 time increase coolant flow rate due increase hydraulic resistance due increase gas velocity range 1000 1200 rpm maximum indicator isothermal efficiency compressor feed rate observed maximum indicator isothermal efficiency supply ratio observed coolant flow rate range 800 mlmin 900 mlmin

This study is presented for the first time in scientific circles. The theoretical basis of the research was the anthropological approach	 the principle of systematicity	 and the problem-chronological method. This methodological framework made it possible to analyze these regional celebrations as a reflection of state policy and the new common culture that was actively forming in the early Soviet society. In conclusion	 the study emphasizes that the 1920s were a time for creating a pantheon of Heroes of the Revolution	 establishing places of historical memory	 and accumulating experience in organizing new public holidays closely related to the strengthening of communist ideology.
